<h1>ESG Invested</h1>

Project Description:
"Project Description: This is a Capstone project for Ada Developers Academy Digital Campus-cohort 18. This idea stemmed from my own fascination with personal finance and investing. ESGInvesting application was built because I wanted to also consider a company's mission and values regarding environmental, social, and governance practices in order to ensure that the investments align with my ethical standards, contribute positively to society, and promote long-term financial sustainability.
